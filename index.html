<h2>WEB</h2>
 <P><strong>The World Wide Web (WWW)</strong>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system
   where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
    (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and
     are accessible over the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users
      by a software application called a web browser.
